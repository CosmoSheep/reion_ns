# Project patchy reionization on ns

We should try to separate the codes that have to do with processing/running 21cmFAST and Gadget2 sims from each other and from the "master" code that will take both P_{m,xHI} and \delta_{HI} (including our new \psi) to generate the main results of our paper. I suggest having different folders in the code folder that Heyang already created.
